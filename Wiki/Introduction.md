#Detailed Description:  
This workshop will guide the user through the steps and considerations standing up a POC that uses Form Recognizer Containers (Pretrained Models only) either in a Kubernetes Cluster.  By the end of the workshop the user should be able to understand the basics of deployment, scaling, and security concerns of deployment in AKS or on-prem clusters.


#Objectives:

After completing this training, you will:

- Learn how to deploy an AKS cluster
- Understand how to choose and AKS Cluster configuration to satisfy your POC requirements
- Understand the basic components of a Kubernetes deployment (Pods, Deployments, Services, etc)
- Learn the format of Helm Charts
- Know how to use 'kubectl' and 'helm' to deploy scripts and debug errors
- Learn how to access and test the containers using the Swagger interface for each container
- Understand some of the security concerns of deploying containers in AKS
